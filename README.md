# Weather-Demo-Web

## Dependencies
Before we can begin, you need to ensure you have a few dependencies installed.

1. Node.js with NPM (Node Package Manager)
2. Angular-CLI (Command Line Interface)
3. Typescript 2.1.6 or higher
4. @angular/cli: 1.0.0  or highrer                                 
5. node: 6.10.0  or higher

To Install Typescript 
> npm install typescript@2.2.1 --save

To check whether or not you have Node.js installed, visit your console / command line and type:
> node -v
If this command goes unrecognized, you need to install Node.js.
1.	Visit the Node.js download page and choose either the Windows or Mac installer based on your OS.
2.	Accept the agreement, choose an installation folder, and hit Next on the Custom Setup page. By default, it will install the npm package manager which we will need.
After it's installed, close your console / command line and reload it. You can now run the node -v command and it will provide you with the current version number.
Next, we need to install the Angular-CLI. This tool allows you to create Angular projects as well as help you with various development tasks. At the console, type:


## Installing Angular 4 with the CLI
• > npm install -g @angular/cli
When we run ng -v while inside an Angular project folder, it will also provide us with which version of Angular that particular project is using. 
• > git clone https://github.com/RamakrishnaMelam/WeatherReport.Web

Note: You will need the git command line tool to run the above command.
After it's installed:
> cd WeatherReport.Web
After about a minute or so, you'll be all set!

## Installing Angular 4 without the CLI
• > git clone https://github.com/RamakrishnaMelam/WeatherReport.Web
• > cd WeatherReport.Web
• > npm install

And that's how you install (and upgrade, if need be) an Angular 4 project using the Angular CLI.
Once it's ready, we type:

• > npm start

## And that's it!
